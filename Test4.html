    <h1>About Java</h1>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
    <p>It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
    <p>Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), and web applications.</p>
